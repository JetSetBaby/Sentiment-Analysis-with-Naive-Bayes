# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
In this project, I will be building a ML model to analyze thousands of twitter tweets to predict peoples sentiment. 

This project is very practical because methods like this can enable companies to automatically predict if their customers are happy or not and it's directly applicable to pretty much any company with an online presence. 
This method saves time and money as it get's rid of needing a human to manually review and parse through thousands of tweets and customer reviews. 

# In this project, I will be using: 

Natural Lnaguage Processing (NLP) to convert words(text) found in tweets into vectors(numbers). These numbers will then be fed into an ML model to make predicitons about sentiments. The predictions will be given a label 0 for a positive sentiment and 1 for an negative sentiment.
