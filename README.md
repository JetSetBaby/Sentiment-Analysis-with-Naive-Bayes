# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis with Naive Bayes
In this project, I will be using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a Baysesian learning approach to implement a Multinomial Naive Bayes Algorithm and analyze thousands of twitter tweets to predict peoples sentiment. 

# Real World Application:

This project is very practical as it's directly applicable to almost any company with an online presence. For example, an analysis like this enables companies to automatically predict if their customers are happy or not. This method saves time and money as it get's rid of needing a human to manually review and parse through thousands of tweets and customer reviews. 

# In this project, I will be using: 

Natural Lanaguage Processing (NLP): to convert words(text) found in a corpora of tweets, into vectors(numbers). These numbers will then be fed into an ML model to make predicitons about sentiments. The predictions will be given a label 0 for a positive sentiment and 1 for a negative sentiment. 

MultinomialNb For Naive Bayes Classification: I will train a Naive Bayes Classifier model and assess it's performance.

Sklearn: to create data cleaning pipelines, extract features, transform and vectorize text, and split data into training data and testing data, import MultinomialNB

Natural Learning Toolkit (NLTK): for sentence and word tokenization and word processing

Matplotlib and Seaborn: to visualize data about our tweets corpora during Exploratory Data Analysis

WordCloud: to visualize and showcase word importance from our corpora of tweets.
